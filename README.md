## If you are looking to contribute a template

This repository is used to store the starter templates. Wasp downloads template folders from this repository.

Users call the Wasp CLI with `wasp new` or `wasp new <project-name> -t <template-name>` and then Wasp does the following:
1. Downloads the template folder
2. Replaces some placeholders in the `main.wasp`
  - Replaces `__waspProjectName__` and `__waspAppName__` with user provided `<project-name>`
  - Replaces `__waspVersion__` with the current Wasp CLI version

Adding a new template includes:
1. Create a new folder in the root of the repo
2. Put the placeholders in `main.wasp` instead of the app name, `title` and `version`
3. Add the template in the [`templates.json`](https://github.com/wasp-lang/starters/blob/main/templates.json) file
  ```json5
  {
    "name": "saas", // name shown to the user
    "description": "Includes GPT API, Google auth, Tailwind, & Stripe payments", // description shown to the user
    "path": "saas" // your template folder 
  },
  ```
